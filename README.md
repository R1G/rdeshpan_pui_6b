# PUI Assignment 6B - Finishing the shopping cart
The goal of 6B is to add some JS to make the Shopping Cart interactive and so that it works properly across pages, like an actual ecommerce shopping cart

## regrade requests / updates to 6A ##

#### "-2.5 for low and high fid designs its important to explain the changes from previous iterations." ####  
Brief explanations are now provided for both low and hi fid designs. 

#### "-1 comment CSS code." #### 
Comments used in CSS to differentiate sections, pages, etc.  
  
#### "-3.5 JavaScript does not render correctly and has bugs. Add to cart feature does not properly update and cart does not render correctly." ####   
Bugs were occuring when the window was resized and some elements would overlap others. Fixing z-indexes of the product images and setting max widths and heights fixed this.   
Add to cart feature now updates properly, and user can even add multiple of the same item unlike in 6A. 
Cart page is now actually functional instead of a placeholder like in 6A.
